# Does dropping commit in git repositories reduce its size?

Yes, dropping a commit in a Git repository can reduce its size, but the impact depends on several factors. Here's an explanation:

### **How Dropping a Commit Can Reduce Size**

1. **If the Commit Adds New Data**:
   - If the dropped commit added large files or made significant changes, removing it may reduce the repository size.
   - For example, if you accidentally committed a large binary file and then dropped the commit, the large file would no longer be referenced.

2. **Garbage Collection**:
   - Simply dropping a commit (e.g., by resetting or rebasing) doesn't immediately remove the associated data. Git keeps unreachable objects (like those from dropped commits) in its internal database until a garbage collection is performed.
   - Run `git gc` to clean up unreachable objects and reclaim disk space.

### **When Dropping a Commit May Not Reduce Size**

1. **Objects Are Still Referenced Elsewhere**:
   - If the objects introduced by the commit are referenced by other commits, tags, or branches, they won't be removed.

2. **Repository History Is Retained**:
   - If you only hide the commit (e.g., by creating a new branch or resetting), the data may still exist in the repository and won't reduce its size.

### **Steps to Reduce Repository Size by Dropping Commits**

1. **Drop the Commit**:
   - Use an interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`) or reset (`git reset --hard`) to remove the commit from the history.

2. **Remove Large Files (if applicable)**:
   - If the dropped commit introduced large files, you might need to rewrite history using a tool like `git filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to purge them completely.

3. **Prune and Garbage Collect**:
   - Run these commands to clean up:

```bash
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

### **Final Note**

While dropping commits can reduce repository size, use this approach cautiously. Changing history (e.g., via rebasing or filter-repo) affects all collaborators, so coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts.
